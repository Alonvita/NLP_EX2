# Symbols in the grammar are case-sensitive.
#
# This grammar uses a convention that
#    - terminals are lowercase          (president)
#    - preterminals are capitalized     (Noun)
#    - other nonterminals are all-caps  (NP)
#
# This convention just makes grammars more readable to humans.  Thus:
#
#    - When *you* are writing grammars, you should
#      follow this convention unless you have a good reason not to.
#
#    - But the  *program* should still work with grammars that don't
#      follow this convention.  So how can the program reliably tell
#      the difference between terminal and nonterminal symbols?  If
#      there is at least one rule for rewriting a symbol, then that
#      symbol is a nonterminal and should be rewritten.

# Vocabulary.  Your program can see that "ate" is a terminal
# symbol because there exists no rule for rewriting it.
# Any symbol that can rewrite as a terminal (or a string of
# terminals, like "chief of staff") is called a "preterminal."  Notice
# that a preterminal is a special kind of nonterminal.

1   ConjN   and     # (Label: ADDING 'AND')
1   ConjV   and     # (Label: ADDING 'AND')
1   Conj    that

# ---------- REMARKS ----------

# ADDING 'AND':
#  The word “and” is a very common English word, which is almost always used as a conjunction.
#  However, in some cases, the word can also be used as a noun. Since it's use as a noun is almost
#   always in a certain context, and this context will not be used in this current text, we will not put a weight for it being a noun

# (I):
#   Adding both of these lines will allow us to produce couples like "Sally ate a"

# (II):
#  The word "and" may be used to combine noun with noun or verb with verb. But we have to be careful because we
#   wouldn't want a Conj where Noun-Conj-Verb appears. Hence, the separation to ConjN and ConjV

# ADDING 'THAT':
#  Took the information from the following link: http://partofspeech.org/what-part-of-speech-is-that/
#   In the example given, the 'that' is used before a 'det'. This usage of 'that' is as a Definite Article.
#   After adding the possibility for 'that' as a DefA, we added the rule in line 47


# when 'VP  Verb-NP' created a sentence where 'Verb-Adverb-Noun', I understood that when adding
# adverbs, a structure must remain as follows:
#   1). Verb-Adverb (example: the feather landed softly)
#   2). Verb-Adverb-Det-Noun (example: she shouted angrily at her)
#
#  thus, 'VP-Verb-NP' does not support this structure. Therefore, I added:
#       0.3     Verb    Verb   Adverb
#       0.3     Verb    Verb   NP    Adverb

# added 'S   Verb Conj NP' to support sentences such as "marry that man"

# Noun Conj Noun on 0.5 was way too much... decreased to 0.25

# the following logic tree occurred:
#       VP
#   PP          VP
#  ...      Verb    NP
#        Verb   Adverb
#
# that kinda ruined what I did when I changed 'VP-Verb-NP'... So I needed to restructure
# came up with removing the following lines from level 3:
#       0.3     Verb    Verb   Adverb
#       0.3     Verb    Verb   NP    Adverb
# and adding   0.6     VP      Verb   NP   Adverb
# in the process I also understood that I had a logical error where level 3 called level 2 (see Verb-NP-Adverb)

# the following logic tree occurred:
#       PP
#   PP          VP
#  ...      Verb    Noun
# which is supposed to be Verb-Det-Noun... changed the following:

#       1       NP      Nom
#       1       NP      DN
#       0.6     DN      Det Noun
#       1       VP      Verb  DN
#       1       VP      Verb   DN   Adverb


# Verb-Conj-Det-Noun occurred after the last change. Need to modify better
# removed: 'NP  DN'
# added: 'S     DN-VP'


# "Bill under every chief of staff" - the 'Noun-Prep-Det-Noun' is incorrect. Must have DT before PP
# removed: 'VP   PP  VP'
# added:    'S   DN  PP  VP'

# added 0.6     VP Verb   Conj Dn   to support sentence (d).

# The following lines:
#   1       LVP     LVerb NAVerb
#   1       LVP     LVerb Adverb NAVerb
# allow us to build sentences like:
#   "Sally is Beautiful"
#   "Harry is rarely happy"



#
# 0.5     S       S Conj S
# 1       VP      ProN   Verb DN
# "She cried every time taht he hit the boy."
