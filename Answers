Part 1:
    a). The reason that the program generate so many long sentences is because of the Grammar's
         weights. For example, once changed NP to 0.2 (w) we will get shorter sentences

    b). We only have one rule that leads to Adj Noun, and eventually Noun will be a word due to
         non-deterministic choices, and the adjectives stop.

    c). We will have to change the weight of the following rules:
            NP  NP PP (down)
            Noun    Adj Noun (up)

        When using NP 0.2 and Noun 2-3 we were able to generate better sentences
