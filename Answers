Part 1:
    a). The reason that the program generate so many long sentences is because of the Grammar's
         weights. Specifically, the rule NP -> NP PP creates a recursion that has great probability of deepening.
         Indded, once the weight of this rule changed to 0.2 (w), we got shorter sentences


    b). Noun will generate Adj Noun rarely, because its probability is equal to the one of every terminal,
         and so only 1 in 6 times it does get an adjective.

    c). We will have to change the weight of the following rules:
            NP  NP PP (down)
            Noun    Adj Noun (up)

        When using NP 0.2 and Noun 2-3 we were able to generate better sentences
