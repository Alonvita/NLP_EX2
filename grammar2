# Symbols in the grammar are case-sensitive.
#
# This grammar uses a convention that
#    - terminals are lowercase          (president)
#    - preterminals are capitalized     (Noun)
#    - other nonterminals are all-caps  (NP)
#
# This convention just makes grammars more readable to humans.  Thus:
#
#    - When *you* are writing grammars, you should
#      follow this convention unless you have a good reason not to.
#
#    - But the  *program* should still work with grammars that don't
#      follow this convention.  So how can the program reliably tell
#      the difference between terminal and nonterminal symbols?  If
#      there is at least one rule for rewriting a symbol, then that
#      symbol is a nonterminal and should be rewritten.

# The basic grammar rules.  Here's what the abbreviations stand for:
#    S  = sentence
#    NP = noun phrase
#    VP = verb phrase
#    PP = prepositional phrase
#    Det = determiner (sometimes called "article")
#    Prep = preposition
#    Adj = adjective

# Vocabulary.  Your program can see that "ate" is a terminal
# symbol because there exists no rule for rewriting it.
# Any symbol that can rewrite as a terminal (or a string of
# terminals, like "chief of staff") is called a "preterminal."  Notice
# that a preterminal is a special kind of nonterminal.

# ---------- REMARKS ----------

# ADDING 'AND':
#  The word “and” is a very common English word, which is almost always used as a conjunction.
#  However, in some cases, the word can also be used as a noun. Since it's use as a noun is almost
#   always in a certain context, and this context will not be used in this current text, we will not put a weight for it being a noun

# (I):
#   Adding both of these lines will allow us to produce couples like "Sally ate a"

# (II):
#  The word "and" may be used to combine noun with noun or verb with verb. But we have to be careful because we
#   wouldn't want a Conj where Noun-Conj-Verb appears. Hence, the separation to ConjN and ConjV

# ADDING 'THAT':
#  Took the information from the following link: http://partofspeech.org/what-part-of-speech-is-that/
#   In the example given, the 'that' is used before a 'det'. This usage of 'that' is as a Definite Article.
#   After adding the possibility for 'that' as a DefA, we added the rule in line 47
